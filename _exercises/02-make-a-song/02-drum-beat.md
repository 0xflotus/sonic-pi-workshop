Letâ€™s look at how to create a simple drum beat, consisting of a kick drum, snare and hi-hat. You'll get to know two new things: `live_loop` and `sample`.

Start with a empty buffer and create a `live_loop` called `:drums`. It could be named anything, the names is just for quickly identifying what the loop does. Live_loop is an endless loop that syncs with other live_loops (a live_loop has to have at least one sleep):

{% highlight ruby %}
live_loop :drums do
  sleep 1
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now you have your empty loop. Let's do a simple backbeat with kick drum on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Instead of playing notes, you will be triggering samples. It's as simple as writing `sample :sample_name`. Here's an example drumbeat:

{% highlight ruby %}
use_bpm 100

live_loop :drums do
  sample :drum_heavy_kick
  sleep 1
  sample :drum_snare_hard
  sleep 1
  sample :drum_heavy_kick
  sleep 1
  sample :drum_snare_hard
  sleep 1
end
{% endhighlight %}

That's a steady backbeat. Change the tempo and play with the samples. When you start writing the sample name, you can browse different samples with the auto-complete feature. Try different samples and check out what they sound like.

The `:drums` loop starts with a kick, plays snare on the two, kick on three, then a snare on the four. Then the loop starts again:

## Add hi-hat

Now add a hi-hat. Create another live loop called `:hihat` and add your hi-hat samples. You could do for example straight 8th or 16th notes like this (this is 16th notes):

{% highlight ruby %}
live_loop :hihat do
  sample :drum_cymbal_closed
  sleep 0.25
end
{% endhighlight %}

But it doesn't have to be so square. You could also go for a bit more funky like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
live_loop :hihat do
  sample :drum_cymbal_closed
  sleep 0.25
  sample :drum_cymbal_pedal
  sleep 1
end
{% endhighlight %}

The polyrhythmic hi-hat pattern was fist a "mistake". The loop is 1.25 beats long instead of the supposed 1. But it sounds cool! So remember to make a lot of mistakes to find something you weren't even looking for.

Now the song looks something like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
use_bpm 100

live_loop :drums do
  sample :drum_heavy_kick
  sleep 1
  sample :drum_snare_hard
  sleep 1
  sample :drum_heavy_kick
  sleep 1
  sample :drum_snare_hard
  sleep 1
end

live_loop :hihat do
  sample :drum_cymbal_closed
  sleep 0.25
  sample :drum_cymbal_pedal
  sleep 1
end
{% endhighlight %}

Play around with different samples and rhythms. You could also add a third live_loop for percussions or other effects. Next you'll create a bass track for your composition.
