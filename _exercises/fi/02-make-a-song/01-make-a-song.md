title: Make a song

Let's dig deeper into Sonic Pi by composing a song. Now you have a rough idea about how to play notes of different lengths with Sonic Pi. That's cool but we can do so much more!

## This chapter

You'll start with creating a drum beat and getting to know the `live_loop`. Then you will add a bass track and finish the song by adding a melody!

## Tweak the sounds

If you want to explore more with Sonic Pi you can continue to tweak the sounds. In the second chapter you'll learn how to use effects and tweak different options to create a richer soundscape.

## Last chapter

And there's even more. In the third chapter you can create a generative piece out of you composition. You can create algorithms to generatively create parts of your track.


Sounds pretty sweet! Let's get started with the beat then!
